# Project10


To run this program, you will need to downalod the Project10Files folder and navigate to that. Keep everything where it is in the folder as the main script relies on the other files being where they currently are. 

The movement controls are the same as the last project. I did not change the camera script, but I did move the objects as mentioned in the feedback.
